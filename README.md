# TermPaymentsCalculatorAPI

The TermPaymentsAPI calculates your monthly term payments.
Your term payments can be calculated with a repayment schedule based on annuity or linear.

This project uses the maven wrapper, see https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper
This wrapper downloads the correct maven version in order to do a clean install or run the application.

## Local development
Running the API it's self (from the project root)

    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    
## Maven clean install
Performing a maven clean install

    ./mvnw clean install
